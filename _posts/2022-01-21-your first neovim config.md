What the hell is neovim and why?

Hello geeks, if you are new to this vim rabbit hole you might have a lot of questions like I do when i first know about it. Basically, vim is a text editor and neovim is the modernize version of vim. The main benefit of vim/neovim is in its philosophy which is, keyboard good mouse bad, and it makes you feels like a movie-hacker (isn't this enough?). It's open source and with the help of plugins(and a lot of work) one can turn vim/neovim into a powerful IDE.

Silly me, try this route turn vim into a fully functional IDE and and here is my 2 cents:
> https://code.visualstudio.com/

This doesn't mean neovim can't be a good IDE but for the learning curve to use neovim as an IDE is steep. If you just start out like me you probbaly spend 90% of the times reading plugins documentation and have absolutely no clue what's is going on.

But there is a catch, being a good text-typer aka programmer is not only about being good at coding. Being fast and efficent in yours text editor is also a important skill(you know, to flex on others). Using neovim teach me exactly this and when I switch back to VScode with the help of the Vim emulation plugins I approach MACH 20 at text typing(just kidding). So in this short blog I will share my 2 minimal config for neovim, no plugins involves.
